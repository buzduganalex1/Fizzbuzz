# Setup

- Create a new solution in visual studio
- Add a new C# project with an appropriate name to the solution
- Add a new C# test project with an appropriate name to the solution

# Requirements
- The function takes as __input a string__ and __outputs a string__. 
  - The function must return a string using the following rules:
    ```
    if the number is divisible by 3 then return “fizz”
    if the number is divisible by 5 then return “buzz”
    if the number is divisible by both 5 and 3 then return “fizzbuzz”
    otherwise just return the number itself
    ```
- Add several test methods that validate your implementation for the created function.

# Examples

```
Input: 3 Output: fizz
Input: 10 Output: buzz
Input: 15 Output : fizzbuzz
Input: 7 Output: 7
```
