# Fizzbuzz

Create a new C# project with visual studio, create a class and add a new function that accepts an integer. The function must implement a loop from 1 to the integer that was passed into the function. In the loop the function must print the following to the command window:

if the number is divisible by 3 then print “fizz”
if the number is divisible by 5 then print “buzz”
if the number is divisible by both 5 and 3 then print “fizzbuzz”
otherwise just print the number itself

Create a test project and add a test class with several test methods that validate your implementation for the created function.
